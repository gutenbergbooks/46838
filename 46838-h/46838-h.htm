<p class="pmb3" />


<h2 class="no-break"><a id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br /><br />

<span class="font08">THE ISLAND AS A WHOLE</span></h2>


<p>Either Ruskin or Wordsworth&mdash;I forget for the
moment which&mdash;says somewhere that the English
Lake Country begins where its mountains first
become visible over the sands of Morecambe Bay.
This, indeed, is a proper rebuke to the foolish
modern tendency&mdash;so entirely subversive of all
real aesthetic appreciation&mdash;which wishes always
to hurry us (too frequently by railway) into the
very heart of a beautiful district, instead of
encouraging us to approach it by insensible
gradations, thus allowing its beauties to work up
gradually to their natural and proper climax.
Luckily this mistake is impossible in the case of
the Isle of Man, which is necessarily approached
by water. It is astonishing, indeed, from what
great distances its mountains are visible over the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[p. 6]</a></span>
Irish Sea. On any fine evening they are plainly
conspicuous from anywhere along the level strip
of land that constitutes the south-west coast of
Cumberland; it is not necessary, in fact, to
climb to the summit of Black Comb in order
to see</p>

<div class="block4">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0 font09">Main ocean, breaking audibly, and stretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0 font09">Far into silent regions blue and pale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0 font09">And visibly engirding Mona's Isle.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The prospect thus afforded is one of singular
distant attractiveness, though the Isle of Man
presents no such splendid group of huddled peaks
as the Cumberland fells present, in their turn, as
seen from the Isle of Man. Only North Barrule,
indeed, towards the north end of the island, rises
to a distinct and graceful cone.</p>

<p>The Isle of Man has suffered, if we may say so
without paradox, from the excess of its own
popularity. For many years past it has been the
favourite touring ground of holiday-makers from
the crowded manufacturing district of South
Lancashire; and this, perhaps, has rather tended
to discourage those quiet lovers of Nature who,
though not exactly addicted to taking their
pleasures sadly, at any rate prefer to enjoy
occasional solitude, and do not always appreciate
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[p. 7]</a></span>
the joys of a noisy crowd. Douglas, indeed, in
the season is crowded with merry trippers, who
pour into it from steamer after steamer, and tax
its accommodation to the breaking point. And
what is true of Douglas is perhaps also true, in a
modified degree, of Ramsey, and even of Port
Erin and Peel. These, of course, are centres
from which brakes and char-&agrave;-bancs and waggonettes
perambulate every corner of the island; even
the culminating summit of Snaefell itself is now
climbed by a double line of electric railway, and
crowned by a huge hotel. "Pretty as the island
is," says Mr. Haskett Smith, "its hills are
nothing more than hills, except where they are
also railways or tea-gardens." Tea-gardens, no
doubt, are abundantly in evidence; and there is
scarcely a glen in the whole island that is not
rigorously kept under lock and key, and only to
be opened at a price. The tripper element, again,
in the Isle of Man is probably responsible for the
absence of the old-fashioned mountain inns&mdash;like
Wastdale Head, in Cumberland, or Penygwryd,
near Snowdon&mdash;that form so pleasant a feature
among the mountains of England and Wales.
There even was once a dancing saloon in the
lonely recesses of Injebreck; and no one who
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[p. 8]</a></span>
loves mountains tolerates dancing in their secret
recesses, unless indeed it be the fairies dancing
their "ringlets to the whistling wind."</p>

<p class="pmb1">Most people indeed who love Nature will
avoid Mona in the "season"; but luckily the
"season" is short. From October to Easter the
lodging houses are empty, and the island lives its
own peculiar life. It is remarkable, indeed, how
little permanent harm has been done to its
pleasant landscapes by this yearly incursion of the
southern Goths and Vandals. Fashion has not
dotted its hills with villas, as Windermere has
been dotted, and to some extent Ambleside and
Coniston. The two streams of life that meet
here in summer flow together for a time side by
side, but do not seem to commingle. Go there
in spring when the fields are full of lambs, and
the hedgerows are yellow with primroses. Climb
the rolling moorlands that are still red with
winter bents, and wander along the hills that
drop into the sea so steeply between Peel and
Bradda Head. Linger in the old churchyards
at Kirk Maughold and Kirkmichael among the
immemorial cross-slabs of a long since vanished
race; sit among the ruins of St. Patrick's Island&mdash;broken
cathedral and broken castle, old,
mysterious round tower, and ruined pre-Conquest
church&mdash;till the place is peopled again with
dead voices and dead faces, and till the whole
island</p>

<span class="font08">CONCERNING PEEL</span></h2>


<p>There is hardly a pleasanter spot in the island
from which to explore its beauties than Peel.
Situated on its west coast, at a point sufficiently
equidistant from its north and south extremities,
and as much out of reach of the corrupting
influence of Douglas as any centre well can be in
an island of such insignificant dimensions, Peel is
not merely an admirable centre from which to
make excursions, but in itself is one of the
quaintest and most picturesque of little towns.
Castletown, in fact, is its only possible Manx
rival, and Castletown ranks below it by a very
long interval. The inland parts of the town, no
doubt, are dull, as new parts of most towns are
apt to be everywhere; but the ancient nucleus of
the place, at the exact point where the little
River Neb flows out into the sea, and St. Patrick's
Island (which is now no longer an island, but an
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[p. 11]</a></span>
artificial peninsula), are as picturesque and old-fashioned
as anyone can wish. St. Patrick's
Island, indeed, whether viewed at close quarters
from the little pier on the opposite side of the
harbour&mdash;where sometimes at night one almost
stumbles over piles of freshly caught fish that are
left there to glimmer and glint in the moonlight&mdash;or
seen from a distance from the coast to the
north of Peel Bay, is probably the most striking
object in the whole Kingdom of Man. Possibly
the Rock of Cashel, which the writer has never
seen, is crowded with points of interest as many
and as diverse: nowhere else, he fancies, in the
range of the British seas is it possible to discover
such variety of interest concentrated in a space so
diminutive as this. Here is an old castle and a
ruined palace, a round tower, a roofless cathedral,
and an old pre-Conquest church. None
by itself is of great importance, but the aggregate
(bounded in seven acres) is imposing in its
"infinite variety." The round tower, of course,
has analogies in Ireland, and at Abernethy, Egilsay,
and Brechin, in Scotland; but is absolutely without
parallel in England. Much learning has
been expended on the meaning of these structures,
which were possibly nothing more or less than
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[p. 12]</a></span>
places of refuge, strange as their shape may
appear for this purpose, for people to take shelter
in times of sudden scare. The Peel round
tower, however, differs from its Scottish and
Irish neighbours in being of one uniform
diameter from bottom to finish, not tapering like
the others towards its top. The cathedral of
St. Germain, now derelict and roofless, exhibits
more distinctive architectural features than any
other old church in the island. Parts of it date
from the thirteenth century; and many bishops
of Sodor and Man have been buried inside its
walls. One of these, Samuel Rutter, who died
in 1662, is commemorated still by an inscription
so quaint&mdash;it is easy to believe that it was
written by himself&mdash;that we may be pardoned
for setting out most of it at length: "In hac
domo quam A vermiculis accepi confratribus
meis, spe Resurrectionis ad vitam, Jaceo Sam,
Permissione divina Episcopus Hujus Insulae.
Siste Lector vide ac ride palatium episcopi.
Obiit XXX° die mensis Maij anno 1662."
This is very wittily Englished thus in Black's
guide-book:</p>

<p>The crypt below the church is said once to
have been used as a prison for Eleanor Cobham,
Duchess of Gloucester, who bulks so largely in
the second part of Shakespeare's <i>Henry VI.</i>
"Not all these lords," exclaims the infuriated
Margaret,</p>

<div class="block4">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not all these lords do vex me half so much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Duchess was accused in 1441 of treason
against the King's life; and was condemned, after
doing penance for three days in the streets of
London, bareheaded, and with a lighted taper
in her hand&mdash;Shakespeare adds in a white sheet
and with naked feet&mdash;to be kept in prison for life.
Shakespeare, or whoever wrote the Second Part
of <i>Henry VI.</i>, makes her sent at once to the Isle
of Man, in the custody of its governor, Sir John
(it should have been Sir Thomas) Stanley. It
appears, however, from the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i> that she was first incarcerated at
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[p. 14]</a></span>
Chester, and afterwards at Kenilworth; and it
was only in July, 1446, that she was removed to
the Isle of Man, where "she is said to have been
imprisoned in Peel Castle till her death." Mr.
W. R. Hall Caine, on the contrary, though he goes
into no detail, states roundly that "the Duchess
was never a prisoner in Peel Castle" at all&mdash;"she
never set foot on our island." Who shall decide
where doctors disagree? Anyhow, it is extremely
unlikely that she was "cabin'd, cribb'd,
confin'd" in this narrow vault underneath the
cathedral. If Shakespeare may be trusted&mdash;but,
of course, he is no authority&mdash;the lady was to be
kept close prisoner, but treated with due respect:</p>

<div class="block4">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">There to be us'd according to your state.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Stan.</i> Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">According to that state you shall be used.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Another tradition of this strange rock is the
"Spectre Dog," which was introduced by Scott
into the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, with his usual
delightful allusiveness:</p>

<div class="block4">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But none of all the astonished train<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Twas feared his mind would ne'er return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was speechless, ghastly, wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him of whom the story ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spake the spectre-hound in Man.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[p. 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb2">Scott, apparently, to judge from the notes to
the edition of his <i>Poems</i> published at Edinburgh
in 1830, got his material for this reference from
Waldron's <i>Description of the Isle of Man</i>, in
which a tradition is preserved "that an apparition,
called, in the Mankish language, the Mauthe
Dhoo, in the shape of a large black spaniel with
curled shaggy hair, was used to haunt Peel Castle;
and has been frequently seen in every room,
but particularly in the guard-chamber, where,
as soon as candles were lighted, it came and
lay down before the fire, in presence of all
the soldiers, who at length, by being so much
accustomed to the sight of it, lost great part of
the terror they were seized with at its first
appearance." They still, however, "as believing
it was an evil spirit, which only waited permission
to do them hurt ... forbore swearing and
all profane discourse while in its company, and
none cared to be left alone with it," nor was anyone
willing without company to traverse a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[p. 16]</a></span>
certain passage, from which the dog was noticed
to emerge at close of day, and which it entered
again at daybreak. "One night, a fellow being
drunk, and by the strength of his liquor rendered
more daring than ordinary, laughed at the simplicity
of his companions, and, though it was not
his turn to go with the keys, would needs take
that office upon him to testify his courage. All
the soldiers endeavoured to dissuade him, but the
more they said the more resolute he seemed, and
swore that he desired nothing more than that
Mauthe Dhoo would follow him as it had done
the others, for he would try if it were dog or
devil. After having talked in a very reprobate
manner for some time, he snatched up the keys
and went out of the guard-room; in some time
after his departure a great noise was heard, but
nobody had the boldness to see what occasioned
it, till, the adventurer returning, they demanded
the knowledge of him.</p>

<p class="pmb3">But as loud and noisy as
he had been at leaving them, he was now become
sober and silent enough, for he was never heard
to speak more; and though all the time he lived&mdash;which
was three days&mdash;he was entreated by all
who came near him either to speak, or, if he could
not do that, to make some signs by which they
could understand what had happened to him, yet
nothing intelligible could be got from him, only
that, by the distortion of his limbs and features, it
might be guessed that he died in agonies more
than are common in a natural death. The
Mauthe Dhoo was, however, never seen after in
the castle, nor would anyone attempt to go
through that passage&mdash;for which reason it was
closed up, and another way made. This accident
happened about threescore years since, and I
heard it attested by several, but especially by an
old soldier, who assured me he had seen it oftener
than he had then hairs on his head."</p>

<span class="font08">TYNWALD HILL AND THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE ISLAND</span></h2>


<p>Pedestrians who wish to go north-eastward
from Peel to Ramsey have a choice of two very
different kinds of way. The first of these is the
great highroad, which, after the first two miles
or so, runs side by side with the little narrow-gauge
railway, and passes in succession the
villages of Kirkmichael, Ballaugh, and Sulby.
The second is to follow the highway to Douglas
to a point past St. John's, where a lane turns up
to the left in the direction of Greeba Mill; and
thence, climbing on to the moor, to follow the
long line of hill-tops over the summits of Greeba
Mountain, Slieau Ruy, Lhargey Ruy, Colden,
Beinn-y-Phott, Snaefell, Clagh Ouyre, and North
Barrule, till we drop again to sea-level at the
quays of Ramsey Harbour. To those who love
hills, and scrambling over hills, this is probably
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[p. 19]</a></span>
by far the best walk in the island; but the
writer, to be honest, has never had the luck to
take it, though he has viewed the chief Manx
summits at more or less close quarters. A little
beyond the point where one quits the road to
Peel, Greeba Castle is conspicuous on the green
hill slope, with the lately repaired ruin of St.
Trinian's Chapel, lonely in the fields, on the left
just beyond it. This last is now treasured as a
public possession; for Man has displayed a
solicitude for the protection of its old monuments
that England would do well were it tardily to
copy. Unhappily it has been found necessary to
cut down the graceful ash trees that are said
formerly to have sheltered its ruined walls.
Greeba Castle, as is well known, is the Manx
home of the novelist, Mr. Hall Caine, whose
<i>Deemster</i> and <i>Manxman</i> have done so much to
popularize Man in the public imagination. Those
who ignore the fells, and cling to the highroad,
may make one or two good deviations. The
first of these is to follow the Douglas road as far
as Tynwald Hill, and thence turn north towards
Kirkmichael by the side of the little River Neb,
which flows from the recesses of Glen Helen. This
last is one of the best known and most favourite
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[p. 20]</a></span>
glens in the island, and is really very pretty&mdash;more
one can hardly claim for it&mdash;always provided
that we have luck enough to visit it at a
time when it is not overrun by hordes of Douglas
"trippers." The writer has only been in February,
when there was not even a custodian to
exact the usual fee that is demanded for admission.
It is said to get its name from the
daughter of a former owner, who built what is
called the Swiss Cottage&mdash;always a name of disastrous
omen&mdash;and planted a million trees. Many
of these last were burnt down some twenty years
ago or more; and others had been devastated by a
tremendous storm that took place not long before
the writer's visit. It is still, however, a charming
woodland walk to follow up the dell to the
Rhenass Fall towards its head, where the stream
descends over mossy crags in a theatre of deep
seclusion. This is the end of the orthodox glen;
but by climbing above the fall on the open hillside
and penetrating the upland valley that lies
between Colden (1,599 feet) and Sart Fell (l,560
feet), we soon begin to get among the mountains.
Possibly, however, this digression involves some
trespassing; and trespass in Manx law&mdash;I write in
utter ignorance&mdash;may perhaps be invested with
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[p. 21]</a></span>
pains and penalties that do not surround it in
England! Another good digression from the
main highroad may be made by quitting it at
Ballaugh, and proceeding through the Curraghs
by way of Jurby and Andreas. The Curraghs
is the flattest part of the island, and is formed of
alluvial deposits. Ballaugh old church at any rate
is picturesque outside; and two other churches
in this dull corner of the island&mdash;Andreas and
Bride&mdash;have each at least a brace of ancient
crosses. Of these old Manx crosses we hope
soon to say something more, when treating of the
grand collection on the south side of the graveyard
at St. Maughold. Of Manx ecclesiology
there is nothing to be said: it is patently without
interest or value. Peel Cathedral, we have
seen, has a little genuine thirteenth-century work,
and Braddon old church, like Jurby, is pleasant
enough to look on. Moreover, a skilled eye will
doubtless detect traces of mediaevalism in many
a featureless edifice that might seem at first the
uncomely product of the soulless eighteenth
century. But not even the best of the seventeen
old parish churches&mdash;and that, perhaps, is St.
Maughold&mdash;is likely to hold the archaeologist
long, or help to fill his note-book. Even the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[p. 22]</a></span>
pre-Conquest chapel at Peel can hardly be called
an exception; it is simply a matter of four bare
walls, quite without instructiveness or feature.</p>

<p>But whether the visitor proceed from Peel to
Ramsey by highroad, with or without digressions,
or resolve to make a day of it by boldly crossing
the fells, he ought not to fail, in any event, before
quitting the neighbourhood of Peel, to pay a
visit to the famous Tynwald Hill, of which
notice has already been shortly taken in passing.
This lies to the left of the main road from Peel
to Douglas, from which it is plainly visible, just
before entering the village of St. John's. In
itself it is quite inconspicuous&mdash;merely like a
flattened round barrow, with a second, smaller
round barrow, also flattened, on the top of it; but
the spot is one of immense suggestiveness, as well
as of great existing political interest. Every new
Manx law that has passed the House of Keys,
and received the royal assent, is here promulgated
in the open air on July 5 in each year. The
ceremony begins with a service in the adjoining
church; and everyone then adjourns to the
famous hillock&mdash;the Governor (who is now Lord
Raglan), the House of Keys, the Deemsters, the
Bishop, and the people. This rite is a genuine
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[p. 23]</a></span>
antiquity that has come down uninterruptedly
from old time, not a mere artificial attempt at
archaeological revival, like the Dunmow Flitch,
in Essex&mdash;to compare small things with great.
Here, in short, as its very name implies, is perhaps
the last survival in Europe of out-of-door mass
legislation&mdash;the living representative of a now
almost vanished order that has left its traces in
place-names over much of Scandinavian Great
Britain. Dingwall, in Ross, which is virtually the
same word; Thwing, high up on the Yorkshire
Wolds; Laughten-en-le-Morthen (Laughten-in-the-Moor-Thing),
in the extreme south of the
same county; Thingwald, in the Cheshire Wirral;
Tinwald Hill, near Dumfries&mdash;all point indisputably
to the same phonetic origin&mdash;the Norse
<i>tinga</i> (to speak)&mdash;and all indicate alike the former
place of meeting of some more or less important
kind of tribal assembly. In Norway, Canon
Isaac Taylor reminds us, to the present day, the
Parliament is called the Storthing, or Great
Council. As to the constituents of this vastly
old assembly, readers of Mr. Hall Caine will not
need to be reminded that the two Deemsters are
the chief judges of the island. The House of
Keys, which corresponds with the English House
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[p. 24]</a></span>
of Commons, consists of twenty-four members,
elected by a franchise that includes female suffrage.
Man, however, still retains the equivalent
of the English House of Lords; though its
"Council" is not hereditary in character, but
consists of such officials as the Bishop, the Archdeacon,
the Deemsters, the Attorney-General,
and others. The presence in this body of ecclesiastical
dignitaries reminds one of the constitution
of the States of Jersey and Guernsey, in both of
which the rectors of the historic parishes of the
Channel Islands sit as of right at the seat of
legislation. Indeed, the constitutions of all three
countries&mdash;free States within a State&mdash;and their
peculiar relation to England, are worthy of
curious scrutiny and close comparative study.</p>

<p class="pmb2">On the present occasion we propose to make
our way from Peel to Ramsey by neither of the
two alternatives that have briefly been sketched
above. We propose, on the contrary, to take a
composite route&mdash;partly through the lowland,
but mostly over hill&mdash;which will introduce
us alike to Kirkmichael, and Bishop's Court
beyond it, and carry us over the top of Snaefell&mdash;provided
always that it be autumn, spring, or
winter, and that the electric tramway is not running.</p>

<p class="pmb2">From Peel to Kirkmichael we either
follow the highroad, which is never very far
from the sea, or else take the roundabout route by
Tynwald Hill and Glen Helen. Kirkmichael
itself is a hard-featured little village stretching in
a single, long street along the main road to
Ramsey, and distant half a mile from the sea.
Luckily, so far, it has escaped the blight of
"development," and has plenty of character and
local Manx colour. The church was rebuilt in
1835&mdash;no need to state in what style&mdash;but a
fragment of its predecessor remains on the east of
the graveyard. Near this is the tomb of Bishop
Thomas Wilson (d. 1755), with an inscription
by his son, "Who in obedience to the express
Commands of his worthy Father, Declines giving
him the Character He so justly Deserved. Let
this island speak the Rest." There is a portrait
of Bishop Wilson&mdash;no doubt sufficiently fanciful&mdash;in
Mr. Hall Caine's <i>Deemster</i>, where he appears
as the good native Bishop. Wilson, however,
was really a Cheshireman, having been born at
Burton-in-Wirral in 1663; and was educated as
a sizar at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was
a contemporary of the saturnine Jonathan Swift.
In 1692 he was appointed domestic chaplain to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[p. 26]</a></span>
the ninth Earl of Derby, and tutor to his son,
which determined the whole after course of his
life. The Stanleys at this time were no longer
"Kings of Man," but they still possessed
authority almost regal. "In the year 1393 the
Earl of Salisbury sold to Sir William le Scroop,
afterwards Earl of Wiltshire, the Isle of Man,
with the title of King, and the right of being
crowned with a golden crown." In 1406, after
some intermediate dealings with which we need
not here concern ourselves, the island (still carrying
with it, no doubt, the right to "the golden
round") passed to Sir John Stanley, who died in
1414; and with the Stanleys it continued till it
passed by the marriage of an heiress to the Atholl
Murrays in 1736. The regal title, however, had
been dropped by the second Earl of Derby
(d. 1521), "as he preferred being a great lord to
being a petty King." The famous island arms
(Gules three legs in armour embossed and conjoined
at the thighs proper, spurred and garnished,
or) still figure among the many quarterings of
the house of Stanley. They may also be found
on old work in connection with buildings with
which the Stanleys had presumably something to
do&mdash;on the west front, for example, of the
fifteenth-century tower of Bidstone Church in
Cheshire, and on a misericorde in Manchester
Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[p. 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the many other prerogatives
that the ninth Earl of Derby still retained as Lord
of Man was the strange one of appointing its
Bishop. The last Bishop, Baptist Levinz, had
died in 1693, and for some strange reason no
successor had been appointed. It is said that at
last William III. threatened to take the appointment
into his own hand, and the Earl was thus
compelled to make his tardy election. It fell on
Thomas Wilson, who was consecrated at the
Savoy in 1698. Wilson from the first set his
face against corruption, and administered his
diocese with firmness and good-nature. He
seems, in fact, in his remote island diocese, to
have played a part in some ways not dissimilar to
that which was played by the "admirable
Walker" in the Furness parish of Seathwaite.
"He soon became 'a very energetic planter' of
fruit and forest trees, turning 'the bare slopes'
into 'a richly-wooded glen.' He was an equally
zealous farmer and miller, doing much by
his example to develop the resources of the
island. For some time he was 'the only
physician in the island'; he set up a drug-shop,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[p. 28]</a></span>
giving advice and medicine gratis to the poor.
Against the then besetting sin of pluralism
Wilson turned a face of steel; twice he refused
the offer of the rich living of Badsworth, in the
West Riding, which twice his patron offered
him, because he disapproved of non-resident incumbents.
His deep practical piety is manifest
from his two posthumous books, <i>Maxims of Piety
and Christianity</i> and <i>Sacra Privata</i>. But perhaps
the best-known episode in his long episcopate of
more than fifty-seven years&mdash;he died at the patriarchal
age of ninety-three&mdash;was his imprisonment
in Castle Rushen for refusal to pay a fine. In 1722
he had suspended the Governor's chaplain for
administering the Communion to the Governor's
wife, she being then in some sense excommunicate,
and for sanctioning false doctrine. Mulcted
for this interference in a sum of &pound;50, Wilson and
his two Vicars-General elected to go to prison
rather than submit to the tyranny of an authority
that they held to be usurped. Wilson, indeed,
seems to have endeavoured to maintain in the
Isle of Man a system of moral discipline similar
to that the decay of which is deplored in
the Commination Service. His practice, however,
was tolerant; the Quakers are said to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[p. 29]</a></span>
have 'loved and respected him'; Roman
Catholics not infrequently attended his services;
whilst Dissenters, since permitted to stand, or sit,
at the Communion, were content to kneel at the
altar-rails like ordinary church-folk. To burial
inside the walls of a church he exhibited strong
abhorrence; and provision was expressly inserted
in his will that his own body should be interred
in the graveyard." A similar repulsion was
entertained by Dr. Wynne, a former resident of
Mold, in Flintshire, whose sentiments have
found public expression, if I recollect rightly, in
his epitaph, composed by himself. In this case,
unfortunately, by a curious irony of fate, a subsequent
extension of the chancel to the east has
since brought his grave within the compass of
the church.</p>

<p>In the lych-gate on the east side of Kirkmichael
Churchyard are preserved several of
those fine old crosses, though more or less in
fragments, that form the chief archaeological
glory of Man, and are now tended with such
laudable care. Something of these is said on a
later page. The Bishop's Palace at Bishop's
Court, a long mile to the north from the end of
the village, has been the residence of the Bishop
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[p. 30]</a></span>
from at least the thirteenth century, and probably
for very much longer. The bishopric of Sodor
and Man was founded, according to tradition, as
early as the fourth century, when Amphibalus is
reported Bishop in 360; but all its early history
is difficult and obscure. Originally it comprised,
not merely Man, but also the Scottish
Hebrides (Southern Isles, or Sudreys, as opposed
to the Northern Islands, <i>i.e.</i>, the Shetlands and
Orkneys); but the latter were necessarily severed
when the island was wrested from the Scots in
the reign of Edward III. Thomas (d. 1348),
or William Russel (d. 1374), may approximately
be considered as the first solely Manx
Bishop; but the ancient title of Sodor still forms
part of their official title, just as the Kings of
England still continued to quarter the <i>fleur-de-lys</i>
of France long after Mary had lost Calais.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Bishop's Court, however, is a little out of the
way for those who wish to cross the hills from
Kirkmichael to Ramsey. Nor does the place
indeed exhibit any interest for the archaeologist,
though the Bishop's private chapel is at present
used as a kind of pro-cathedral for the diocese.
From Kirkmichael Village there is a track&mdash;that
for part of the distance is no track&mdash;almost
directly due east, which passes between Slieau
Dhoo (1,139 feet), on the north, and Slieau
Fraoghane (1,602 feet), on the south, and ultimately
drops into the head of Sulby Glen at the
bottom of the western slopes of Snaefell.</p>

<p>Or the visitor may retrace his steps toward Glen Helen
as far as the chapel at Baregarrow, passing on the
left the Hill of Reneuriling, sometimes called
Cronk Urleigh, or Eagle Mount, which is said
to have been the original Tynwald Hill of the
island. At Baregarrow a lane turns away to the
left, and winds up along the southern slopes of
Sart Fell (1,560 feet). Whichever route be taken,
as we penetrate the hills we realize more and
more the real nature of Manx mountains. The
central chain of hills extends for about twenty
miles from Bradda Head, a sea-cliff (766 feet), in
the south-west, to North Barrule (1,842 feet), in
the north-east, thus forming a true axis to the
island. The range is interrupted, not exactly in
the middle, but more towards the south, by the
great lateral valley that pierces it completely from
sea to sea, and through which run road and rail
between Peel and Douglas. South of this great
glen the highest summit is South Barrule (1,565
feet); but north of it comes a cluster of much
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[p. 32]</a></span>
higher hills, the culminating point of which is
Snaefell (2,034 feet). These hills are built of
slate, like the hills of Cumberland and North
Wales, but there all analogy ceases. Snowdon
and Scafell Pike are convulsed masses of broken
rock, whose black nakedness is not always scantily
clothed with a coverlet of bracken, or wiry grass,
or sloppy bog-moss. From the foot of the sheer
crags extend long acres of scree-shoot, and the
hills are further torn in every direction by the
deeply furrowed channels of the torrents. In
Man the hill slopes are everywhere smooth, and
modelled in regular contours; they are clad, no
doubt, with moor, and sodden in places with wet,
but crag, and scree, and rock, are almost wholly
absent. They have even less ferocity than Skiddaw;
and Skiddaw, in addition, boasts a splendid
"double-front," and a bold black top that excited
the enthusiasm of even the town-loving "Elia."
What little rock they exhibit is confined chiefly
to the sides of one or two glens&mdash;Sulby Glen, for
instance, which is quite the finest in the island&mdash;and
to the beds of mountain streams; but none
of this is terrific.</p>

<p>The truth indeed is this, that
this central range of Man, though akin to Westmoreland
and Carnarvonshire in its actual make
of rock, is altogether aloof from them in all
tangible characteristics. This is not to dispraise
the hills of Man, but only to rescue them from
the ignominy of an obvious, but quite unfair,
comparison. Manx mountains, in fact, though
thus composed of slate, have really much more
resemblance to the limestone hills of Yorkshire.
They have no pretensions to rank with the
best; but, judged by themselves, they are quite
satisfactorily noble. We are likely, indeed, to
appreciate them all the better, just because
we do not approach them in a mood of too
exalted expectation. On the whole they are
less dull than the Cheviots; and even the
Cheviots are full of all kinds of delightful surprises.</p>

<p>Moreover, as we win higher among the moorlands
by the lane that climbs from Baregarrow,
we realize more and more that charm of all-round
seascape that distinguishes these hills above all
compeers, and gives them their imperishable
charm. The wonderful extent of the view from
Snaefell was noted down as long ago as the
"spacious times of great Elizabeth." Thus,
Camden says quite truly: "In medio montibus
densius attolitur, e quibus aeditissimus Sceafell,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[p. 34]</a></span>
unde sudo coelo Scotia, Anglia, and Hibernia
prospici possit"&mdash;that is, England, Scotland, and
Ireland&mdash;and Wales must be added&mdash;can all be
seen from the top on a clear day. Drayton, in
his <i>Polyolbion</i> (Canto xxvii.), has just the same
remark translated into poetical diction:</p>

<div class="block3">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her midst with mountains set, of which, from Sceafel's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A clear and perfect eye, the weather being bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Be Neptune's visage ne'er so terrible and stern),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Scotch, the Irish shores, and th' English may discern.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>"In clear weather," says Mr. Baddeley, "not
only is the 'tight little island' itself mapped out
beneath the eye, with the exception of a strip of
the coast here and there, but Scotland is plainly
visible, from the Mull of Kintyre to beyond
Dumfries; Ireland is represented by the Mourne
Mountains; England by the giants of the Lake
District; and even Wales shows up, with the
Peak of Snowdon, the 'Carnedds'&mdash;Dafydd and
Llewelyn&mdash;and the range extending thence, Penmaenmawr
to the Great Orme, with, maybe, the
Clwydian range, in cloud-like outline, far away
in the south-east. The nearest point of England
to Snaefell is St. Bees Head, 38 miles distant;
of Scotland the Whithorn Promontory, 30 miles;
of Ireland the entrance to Strangford Lough,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[p. 35]</a></span>
36 miles; and of Wales the northern coast of
Anglesey, 56 miles; Scafell is 50 miles away;
Merrick, the highest Scottish mountain south of
Edinburgh and Glasgow, 60; Slieve Donard, the
highest in the North of Ireland, 60; and Snowdon,
80."</p>

<p>The lane by which we are now travelling,
though sufficiently rough-and-tumble, is one over
which it is possible to push a bicycle; the writer
himself has done it. It is not, in fact, the least
strange feature of these Manx hills that they are
thus traversed by high-level roads&mdash;not actually,
indeed, climbing to the tops of the mountains,
but winding in and out among them not far below
their summits. One of these, between Douglas
and Ramsey, and immediately under the shadow
of Snaefell itself, has been engineered, I fancy, of
quite recent years. One is reminded a little of
the many new upland roads that the French are
now constructing in Auvergne among the mountains
of Mont Dore. Climbing along the south
breast of Sart Fell, with the Rhenass stream
below us on the right (which flows ultimately
down Glen Helen), we come presently to the
slight <i>col</i> between the valleys of the Rhenass and
the Sulby, just before surmounting which the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[p. 36]</a></span>
heavy, dome-like top of Snaefell starts suddenly
up through the nick of the pass, with its castellated
hotel on its summit. The electric rail from
Laxey&mdash;a hideous double line&mdash;almost completely
encircles the bare, flattened cone of the hill as it
winds round it in gradual ascent, exactly in the
fashion in which the line from Clermont-Ferrand
(though this is served by an ugly
monster that vomits out volumes of smoke) winds
up the Puy de D&ocirc;me, almost like the peel of an
orange. It must be pleaded, however, in excuse
of the tram-road up Snaefell&mdash;if any plea may be
heard to extenuate its bare existence&mdash;that at least
it has not scarred harsh lines round the hill, as is
the case with its central French rival&mdash;lines that are
plainly visible, on a reasonably clear day, eighteen
miles away, or thereabouts, from the top of the Puy
de Sancy. The view now opens on the left into the
head of Sulby Glen&mdash;more properly Glen Mooar,
the Big Glen&mdash;the strength of which lies further
to the north, where it deepens beyond the inn at
Tholt-y-Wilt. This is usually reckoned the
finest in the island, and has certainly best pretensions
to recognized mountain grandeur&mdash;if any
spot, indeed, in the whole of the Isle of Man
may properly be styled either mountainous or
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[p. 37]</a></span>
grand. Hereabouts, in succession, two rough
roads turn down, to the south, to Injebreck, deep
in the green valley between Colden and Carraghan
(1,520 feet), and the terminus of a good
driving-road from Douglas. Neither can be
ridden on a bicycle, and one at least, when we
descended it&mdash;but we speak of now two years ago&mdash;was
rapidly being swept away by the fury of
mountain torrents. Thus Injebreck is practically
a <i>cul-de-sac</i>, secluded in the greenest of dale-heads;
and those who are lucky enough to drop
down into it, as the writer dropped down, just
towards sunset on a mild February evening, with
nearly a score of croaking ravens circling above
his head, will reckon it perhaps the most beautiful
spot in the island, and one that still remains
entirely unspoilt, serene in the possession of its
pleasant rustic graces.</p>

<p>Injebreck, however, on our present route, must
be kept for another day: for the moment we
keep the level, round the north face of Beinn-y-Phott
(1,772 feet), till we fall into the great
high-level route already referred to as running
from Douglas to Ramsey. This, at the point of
junction, is crossed by a gate the closing of which
is enforced by the threat of legal penalties&mdash;a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[p. 38]</a></span>
timely reminder that the law of Man is not
always co-extensive with the law of England.
Beinn-y-Phott itself is a prominent summit that
perhaps displays more character than most of its
sister peaks. After all, it may be true that the
names of Manx mountains present greater interest
than Manx mountains themselves. Snaefell, of
course, is the "hill of snow"&mdash;exactly the equivalent
of familiar Snowdon (there are said to be
two Snaefells in Iceland). Cronk-ny-Irey-Lhaa,
on the other hand, which drops so splendidly
into the sea between Glen Maye and Port Erin
(there is a second hill of the same title in the
north division of the island), is said to mean the
"Hill of the Rising Sun," and bears witness to
conditions and an altitude less rigorous.</p>

<p class="pmb3">From the point where our rough cart-track
joins the great high-level road between Douglas
and Ramsey we turn north-eastward along this
latter, between Snaefell and Clagh Ouyre (1,808
feet). Snaefell itself is easily climbed, if the conditions
be really propitious, by diverging to the
left up the gentle hill-slope at almost any point
we like after crossing the electric tramway.
Hereabouts, on our right, we look down into the
deep glen, disfigured by a lead-mine, which ends
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[p. 39]</a></span>
on the sea at Laxey. A little beyond this, when
Snaefell is now behind us, and growing smaller
in the distance, the eye begins to measure the
profound and solemn depths of green and pastoral
Glen Auldyn. The elevation is maintained till
quite near Ramsey, when we plunge down
suddenly from our mountain heights by a drop
of unexpected and startling abruptness. Of
Ramsey I have little to say: there seems little
to say about it. It is said to look charming when
approached from the sea, but the charm must
soon vanish on landing. Down by its quays it is
just a little harbour, with the usual local colour
of a place that lives by shipping and fishing. Of
the parts of the town that live by visitors there is
little to be said for good or for evil.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><br />

<span class="font08">FROM RAMSEY TO LAXEY</span></h2>


<p>From Ramsey the visitor may travel seventeen
miles south to Douglas, returning thence to Peel,
if he like, by railway. At the very beginning,
however, a digression should be made to Kirk
Maughold and St. Maughold's Head, immediately
beyond it. Kirk Maughold, beyond question, is
one of the pleasantest villages in Man, and certainly
for the archaeologist a shrine of the first
importance. Even the little church, in this case,
has some touches of mediaevalism (thirteenth-century
lancets) that redeem it from the general
charge of Manx ecclesiological dulness. The
churchyard in which it stands&mdash;like that of Adel,
in Yorkshire&mdash;is quite disproportionately large,
containing, it is said, nearly four acres. For the
sake of its church alone, however, no one would
come to Kirk Maughold: the magnet that
attracts one is the collection of crosses in the
churchyard, now studiously protected in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[p. 41]</a></span>
picturesque shelter. These, of course, are mostly
pre-Conquest&mdash;the term, it is true, in strictness
has no real application to Man, but at any rate it
serves roughly to indicate a style, if not to disclose
a period. Man is as distinguished for the
number and variety of its old crosses as its far
away sister, Cornwall. Not that Cornish and
Manx crosses have any close affinity&mdash;they
belong, no doubt, to wholly different schools of
ancient Celtic art. Cornish crosses, in particular,
like those in Pembrokeshire and Iona, are
generally cut more or less to the cross-shape
(though it may be only a wheel cross), whereas
those of Man are merely carved in relief on a
slab of rectangular slate. "The erect cross-slabs,"
says the late Mr. J. Romilly Allen, "are, with a
few unimportant exceptions, peculiar to Scotland
and the Isle of Man. They are probably older
than the free-standing crosses, because the erect
cross-slabs are not treated architecturally (as the
high crosses of Ireland are), but resemble more
nearly than anything else ornamented pages from
the Celtic illuminated MSS. directly translated
to stone with hardly any modification whatever
to suit the requirements of the new material to
which the decoration was applied." "There is
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[p. 42]</a></span>
no district," says Mr. P. M. C. Kermode, in his
beautiful volume on "Manx Crosses," of so small
an area which can boast of so great a number of
monuments of this class, extending over such a
lengthy period, and having such a variety of
interest&mdash;Ogam, Latin, and Runic inscriptions,
Celtic art with its Scandinavian applications and
development, Christian symbols and pagan myths.
Altogether, according to this same authority, the
island has one hundred and sixteen old crosses,
extending over a period of six centuries, forty-five
of which may be called Scandinavian and
seventy-one pre-Scandinavian. Not one of the
seventeen old parishes is wholly without an
example, though Ballaugh, Lezayre, and Patrick
have only one each. Kirkmichael, however, has
ten; whilst Maughold has actually thirty-seven&mdash;by
far the biggest collection in the island.
Kirk Braddon also exhibits some extremely interesting
examples. Most of these cross-slabs are
commemorative of the dead; and one of the
inscriptions at Kirkmichael (as in Black's <i>Guide
to the Isle of Man</i>) may fairly be given as typical
of the rest:</p>

<div class="block4">
<blockquote>
<p class="pmb2">Joalf son of Thorolf the Red erected this cross to his mother
Frida.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<p class="break" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43a"></a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
  <img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="650" height="457" alt="THE CALF OF MAN, FROM SPANISH HEAD." title="" />
  <p class="center">THE CALF OF MAN, FROM SPANISH HEAD.<br />
    <span class="font08">The Calf is at the southern extremity of the island and is
      separated by the narrow and dangerous Calf Sound,
      on the right of the picture.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="pmb3" />


<p class="break" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[p. 43]</a></span></p>

<p>One of those, however, at Kirk Maughold is not
strictly a cross-slab at all, but seems merely to
have been carved on a face of rock by the village
priest&mdash;perhaps in a moment of leisure on some
pleasant summer afternoon, just as Wordsworth
carved the name of "Joanna"</p>

<div class="block3">
<blockquote>
<p>Above the Rotha, by the forest side.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>It comes from Keeil Woirrey, Corna, and bears
the touching Runic inscription: "Christ Malachi
Patrick and Adamnan (perhaps an invocation of
the worthy pastor's patron saints): of all the
sheep John is the Priest in Corna Dale."</p>

<p>But these prehistoric cross-slabs, if prehistoric
we may call them&mdash;and though certainly they
are not prehistoric in the strict and proper sense
of the word, they are prehistoric in the sense of
reaching far back into paths of history that are
only dimly lighted, and are difficult to traverse&mdash;do
not exhaust the archaeological treasures in
which Kirk Maughold is so rich. On the strip
of village green, as we approach the churchyard,
is a picturesque, seventeenth-century sundial on
three steps, with the inscription: <i>Eus. (Edwardus)
Christian fecit, 1666</i>. Christian, I believe, like
Quaile, is still a common Manx surname. Hard at
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[p. 44]</a></span>
hand is another old cross, but, of course, far later
than those in the churchyard. This, in its present
state, measures more than 10 feet in height, and
its head&mdash;perhaps later than the shaft&mdash;which is
sculptured with a ring and cross, a chalice and
missal, and the famous arms of Man, and
surmounted above all by a Crucifixion and
Virgin and Child, is a rare and very interesting
survival.</p>

<p>From Kirk Maughold we need not return to
Ramsey to recover the main road to Douglas. On
the contrary, we may proceed through pleasant
country lanes that are tiresomely up and down
hill and not a little roundabout, and enter the
highroad after traversing that very Corna Dale of
all of whose sheep Presbyter John, we have seen,
was shepherd a thousand years ago or more.
North Barrule (1,842 feet) all the way is a lovely
peak in front&mdash;more shapely, perhaps, and richer
in its blending of upland and lowland colour than
any other summit in the island. It is this peak
which is so graceful and conspicuous in distant
views of Man, as seen, for example, from the
coast of Cumberland, in the neighbourhood of
St. Bees. The great highroad, when once
accomplished, proves somewhat too hard, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[p. 45]</a></span>
straight, and broad, and white for any except the
cyclist; for him it is ideal, supposing him to
have spent his morning in wheeling his way with
sorrow and pain up the steep rough lanes that
rise from Kirkmichael towards Snaefell. The
sea, however, as we draw near Dhoon Glen&mdash;a
deep gash down below us on the left&mdash;grows
more and more magnificent beneath us; and
presently, just before doubling the sudden corner
that gives access to Glen Laxey, road and tramway
run together (the latter might be spared) on
the edge of a sheer cliff that looks down from an
almost giddy height on the waves that break far
down below. This is one of the finest "bits" on
a hard highroad in Man, but to the cyclist it is
gone in a moment. Laxey opens out as suddenly,
as the road turns the corner of the glen (into which
it drops, and out of which it rises, by a huge but
inevitable zigzag), as Nice opens out to those who
turn the corner of the hill on the road down from
Villefranche and Beaulieu. This large and prosperous
village&mdash;it is really a little town&mdash;occupies
a situation entirely different from any other settlement
in the island&mdash;it is rather like that of
Lynmouth&mdash;on the short strath where two glens
commingle (Glens Laxey and Roy) before their
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[p. 46]</a></span>
united waters run out into the sea. Laxey, to
the writer's taste, is far too big and straggling&mdash;untidy,
perhaps, is too unkind a word to use of it&mdash;to
make an idyllic centre from which to explore
the hills. It should be borne in mind, however,
that it is a nearer starting-point to Snaefell than
any other centre in the island: the mountain tram,
in fact&mdash;if that be not, indeed, a positive detraction&mdash;actually
starts from its doors. But in the
popular imagination the outstanding feature of
Laxey (connected with the industry of lead-mining)
is undoubtedly the famous Great Wheel,
which is probably familiar from photographs and
pictures in advertisements to many thousands of
Englishmen who have never set foot on the
island at all. It was erected in 1854, and
measures "72-1/2 feet in diameter (as compared
with 50 feet of the big Catrine Wheel in Ayrshire)
and about 220 in circumference. The
breadth is 6 feet; it revolves at a maximum
speed of two rounds with a capacity for raising
250 gallons per minute." Its business is to keep
the levels of the lead-mines free from water.
"The platform above it, extending from one side
to the top, is 75 feet above the ground, and
reached by a spiral staircase of nearly 100 steps."</p>

into a circle"&mdash;but probably is otherwise unrivalled

<span class="font08">CASTLETOWN AND THE SOUTH SIDE OF
THE ISLAND</span></h2>


<p class="pmb2">It still remains to explore the south side of the
island, commencing again at Peel. Here the
chief interest centres in Castletown, with its
famous Castle Rushen; in the splendid stretch
of coast between Peel and Port Erin; and in the
cliff scenery of Spanish Head and the Calf. The
direct road from Peel to Castletown, turning off
from the Douglas road at St. John's, and proceeding
by way of Foxdale, is a dull affair at best, and
is spoilt at Foxdale itself by the untidy presence
of lead-mines. Beyond Foxdale, indeed, the landscape
improves as we skirt the east slopes of South
Barrule, which have been covered of late years
with extensive fir-plantings, and begin to descend
the hill, with the sea splendidly conspicuous in
front.</p>

<p class="pmb3" />


<p class="break" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[p. 49]</a></span></p>

<p>A much better road is to take the lane
due south from Peel that skirts the head of Glen
Maye, and winds up to the pass on the west of
South Barrule. This, of course, is a rougher
route, and involves much additional hill. Better
still for the pedestrian is a composite, roundabout
way that follows the grand coast-line more or less
closely to Port Erin, and bends thence to the east
for Castletown. Two days may easily be spent on
this last journey by sleeping at Port Erin, and
spending the bulk of the following day in a
leisurely exploration of the Calf.</p>

<p>From Peel the coast-line may be followed the
whole distance to the mouth of Glen Maye; but
the path, so far as it exists, is in places rather giddy,
and approaches unpleasantly near to the edge of
the cliff. We believe that it is examined every
year before the beginning of the "season" to
make sure that it has not slipped away in the
winter months into the gulf below. All inland
view is at first shut out by the huge green slopes
of Peel Hill on our left; but presently, as we
double Contrary Head, the fine southern range of
mountain comprising Cronk-ny-Irey-Lhaa (1,449
feet), the Carnanes (1,000 feet), and Bradda
Head (768 feet), is seen dropping to the sea, more
directly and more abruptly than perhaps any other
hills to the south of the Border (in Scotland it is
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[p. 50]</a></span>
matched on the southern coast of Mull), except
perhaps Penmaenmawr and the north coast of
Exmoor. The view hence, looking south, is impressive,
or even deserves the epithet "grand"; at
no other spot in the island do mountain and sea
group in a single picture in such intimate proximity
as here. At Glen Maye the line of cliff is
abruptly interrupted by the little stream that here
descends from Glen Rushen. The best of this glen
is probably where it debouches on the sea; higher
up, however, it becomes wooded, and exhibits a
small waterfall, but is apt, perhaps, in "tripper-time"
to be somewhat unpleasantly popular. At
the head of the glen we regain the main road,
by which we might have travelled, had we liked,
directly from Peel. Passing the hamlet of Dalby,
and always looking down on the sea on our right,
we come shortly to a fork half a mile beyond the
church, where a lane drops down due south (the
right-hand branch of the fork) into the hollow
of Dalby Lhag. At the bottom of this is a tiny
rill pleasantly hidden among trees. We are now
virtually at sea-level, but in the course of the
next mile we rise nearly 800 feet. The ascent is
by a kind of rocky staircase, in which the bare
ribs of the earth have been stripped of their scanty
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[p. 51]</a></span>
covering of soil. At the top of this, where we
join a better lane that comes over Cronk Fedjag,
we strike away to the right, over high grass
pastures, to the fairly obvious summit of Cronk-ny-Irey-Lhaa:
the lane goes down to Port St.
Mary (with a turn to the right for Port Erin),
keeping the range of mountain between the sea
and itself. On Cronk-ny-Irey-Lhaa and the
neighbouring ridge of the Carnanes&mdash;the two are
only severed by the sudden notch of the Slack&mdash;those
who are free to wander may well wander a
summer day, or bask a whole morning in the sunlight,
stretched out on the scented turf,</p>

<p>It is astonishing that a hill-range of such minor
elevation should clothe itself in attributes of such
really mountainous dignity. From the end of
the Carnanes we drop cautiously to the sea at
Fleswick Bay, whence those who are weary of
much up-and-down may soon make their way to
Port Erin or Port St. Mary. Those, on the
contrary, who are still eager for the hills may yet,
if they like, make another pretty climb by scrambling
up and over Bradda Head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[p. 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Port Erin and Port St. Mary, though only a
mile apart, are almost as different from one another&mdash;though,
of course, in a different way&mdash;as
are Lynton and Lynmouth, in Devonshire, or any
other famous topographical twins. Those who
prefer a watering-place that is almost wholly
watering-place, and not yet spoilt by extravagant
building (though the hands that direct its destinies
had better call a halt); who are content to be
included in a definite bay that is bounded by
definite cliffs; and who are willing to look westward
over unlimited space, in which the sun
sinks magnificently in his "ocean-bath," will get
what they like at Port Erin. Those, on the other
hand, who like to face eastward, and to vary the
monotony of the seascape by distant lines of low
coast; who dislike to be cooped in a narrow
space; and who ask the stronger local colour of
a busy little port, will probably turn to Port
St. Mary. <i>Stat suus cuique honor</i>: each may be
praised without dispraising its rival; though the
writer, were he asked, would find little difficulty
in giving his casting vote between the two. In
any case it is intolerable that the little Manx
railway, when rebuilding Port St. Mary Station,
should have built so conspicuous an erection in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[p. 53]</a></span>
such hideous red-brick. They have done the
same at Douglas and Peel. When will builders
come to realize that red-brick of all complexions
is wholly out of place in a land of grey and
green?</p>

<p>Castletown, till 1862, was officially the capital
of Man, and is still far the least "developed" of
all its four principal towns. It is simply, in fact,
a small, quiet country town, even less spoilt for
visitors than the inland parts of Peel; though
Peel, of course, exhibits, in its peerless St.
Patrick's Isle, features of picturesqueness that we
shall seek for in Castletown in vain. Castletown,
no doubt, would be big and ugly if it could; and
by making golf-links at Derby Haven it has
certainly given hostages to fortune. After all,
there is nothing to see in the place save Castle
Rushen, which is principally keep, with a
narrow ward, and an <i>enceinte</i> wall and ditch that
surround the whole. So narrow a ward, and a
keep so disproportionately big, can be matched
perhaps only at Middleham, in Yorkshire&mdash;once
the home of the "King-Maker"&mdash;where the
keep is late Norman, and the <i>enceinte</i> fourteenth
century. At Castletown, it is asserted, no part of
the existing structure dates back earlier than the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[p. 54]</a></span>
fourteenth, or at earliest the thirteenth, century;
though the castle itself is said to have been
founded&mdash;the account is perhaps mythical&mdash;by
King Guthred the Dane in 947. The keep,
moreover, though so-called in all the guide-books,
is not really a keep at all&mdash;not a single solid
tower, that is, in the sense of Middleham Castle,
or, to take more familiar instances, in the sense
of Rochester, Dover, or London. On the contrary
it is really a minute inner ward surrounded
by an <i>enceinte</i> of quite disproportionate height.
Formerly, under the rule of the house of Stanley,
it served, like the Tower and Windsor Castle, for
castle and palace alike; after that the place was
a prison; and now it is dismantled, save for a handful
of rooms, some of which shelter the Manx
Museum. Most of the apartments are gloomy
enough, and one is glad to escape from them
back into the sunlight: the great slabs of slate,
however, that serve for floor or ceiling&mdash;some of
them measure 12 feet in length&mdash;are surely without
parallel elsewhere. The drawing-room,
which is the biggest room in the castle, has now
an interesting collection of Manx antiquities&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
old rushlight-holders, and the ancient Bishop's
mace; but the object that strikes one most with
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[p. 55]</a></span>
amazement is the splendid skeleton of an Irish elk&mdash;an
animal, of course, that has long since been
extinct&mdash;which was found some sixteen years ago
in a marl-pit near St. John's. This is said to be
complete, and measures about 10 feet across the
antlers&mdash;sufficient indication of its general gigantic
size.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The Isle of Man, as belonging to the Stanleys,
was pertinaciously Royalist in the great Civil
War; and hither retired James, the seventh Earl
of Derby, on July 30, 1644, after the crushing
defeat at Marston Moor on the previous July 2
had finally shattered the cause of the King in the
North. Here he resided with his family in
Castle Rushen for the next six years; and well
would it have been for him had he resided here
till the end. On June 16, 1650, however,
Charles II. landed in the Firth of Cromarty to
commence the new campaign that was destined
to end so disastrously at Worcester; and in the
August of the following year Derby, in his turn,
set foot again on English soil at Wyre Water, in
Lancashire, having been selected by Charles in
the previous year to command the Royalist levies
out of Lancashire and Cheshire. On sailing for
this expedition, from which he was fated never
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[p. 56]</a></span>
to return, he left his wife behind him at Castle
Rushen, under the care of William Christian,
who commanded the insular forces. The Countess
was the famous Charlotte de la Tr&eacute;moille,
daughter of Claude de la Tr&eacute;moille, Duc de
Thouars, and was lineally descended, on her
mother's side, from the great Dutch patriot,
William the Silent. Already, in the course of
the great Civil War, she had distinguished herself
by the defence of Lathom House, in Lancashire,
during the siege of which she had
"rejected with scorn all proposals for surrender,
declaring that she and her children would fire
the castle and perish in the flames rather than
yield." The fortunes of her husband need not
now be further followed, save briefly to record
that he was beheaded by the Parliament at Bolton
on October 15, 1651, having been captured near
Nantwich whilst trying to make his escape alone
after the defeat at Worcester. The unfortunate
Countess, on hearing of his arrest, at once despatched
overtures to England proposing the surrender
of the island in the hope of saving his life.
Whether the proposal was scouted, or arrived too
late, the Earl, we have seen, was put to death;
and it is said that the first intimation that his unhappy
wife received of it was a curt and brutal
sentence (though it may not have been meant as
such)&mdash;"the late Earl of Derby"&mdash;in a letter
from Colonel Duckenfield that was delivered to
her on October 29, calling on her to surrender
Castle Rushen.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary troops had
landed on the island two days previously, it is
practically certain&mdash;though the point has been
disputed&mdash;by the treachery of William Christian.
The distracted Countess was apparently at first
for holding out, but finally surrendered on
November 3. She ultimately died at Knowsley, in
1664, and was buried near her husband in the
parish church of Ormskirk. She had lived just
long enough, however, to see summary vengeance
executed on the traitor by her son, the eighth
Earl. Christian, of course, was included in the
general Act of Indemnity that alone rendered
tolerable the return of Charles to England in
1660. Derby, however, was lord in Man, and
claimed to exercise there peculiar sovereign
powers in his own right. Christian was arrested,
but refused to plead, and could not thus technically
be brought to trial. "The Governor
requested the deemsters and the House of Keys
to inform him what the laws of the island
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[p. 58]</a></span>
provided should be done in the case of a prisoner
refusing to plead. The reply was that the life
and property of the recusant were at the absolute
disposal of the lord of the island." In England
the old remedy in such a case was pressing to
death (the <i>peine forte et dure</i>), but the goods of
the prisoner were not forfeited. It is said to have
been for this very reason (that his property might
descend to his heir), that Walter Calverley refused
to plead when indicted at York for the murder of
his children in 1605. On December 29 the
deemster pronounced sentence of death on Christian,
and four days later he was shot at Hango
Hill on the seashore on the way to Derby
Haven, and, roughly, a mile to the east of Castle
Rushen. The spot is almost exactly opposite King
William's College, and is marked by the slight
ruins of a blockhouse that was built by the
seventh Earl, and by the site of an ancient burial-ground.
He was buried at Malew Church, as
recorded in the parish register&mdash;the last two
sentences in terrible opposition: "Mr. William
Christian of Ronaldsway, late Receiver, was shot
to death at Hangoe Hill, on January 2. He
died most penitently and most courageously, made
a good end, prayed earnestly, made an excellent
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[p. 59]</a></span>
speech, and the next day was buried in the
chancel of Malew." The character of William
Christian has been very variously estimated, but
the islanders regarded him as a patriot martyr,
who died for defending certain of their rights
against the encroachments of the reigning house.
"Baase Illiam Dhone" (The Death of Brown-haired
William) "dwells on the retribution that
befell the families of those who were responsible
for his execution." On the other hand, it seems
certain that Christian was accused in 1658 of
having embezzled extensive revenues of the then
sequestrated bishopric; and whether guilty of
this or not&mdash;he was never brought to trial&mdash;he
certainly fled to England, and this presupposes
his guilt. Popular judgment and critical history
thus often fall at loggerheads; Thomas, Earl of
Lancaster, who was beheaded at Pontefract in
1322, was honoured after his death almost as
though a saint&mdash;Leland, writing in the time of
Henry VIII., speaks of "the Hil, where the goode
Duke of <i>Lancastre</i> was beheddid"&mdash;whilst the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> can find nothing
better to say of him than that "despite his tragic
end, it is difficult to say anything favourable of
Thomas of Lancaster."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[p. 60]</a></span></p>

<p>In what has been said we have endeavoured
to treat generally of all that is really best worth
seeing in Man, dwelling briefly on those topics,
whether of history or topography, that seem
really of most validity, and passing in silence
those aspects of the island&mdash;luckily few and
often temporary&mdash;that appear to the writer not
in harmony with its true and permanent charms,
and in some cases even repellent. It would be
pleasant in conclusion, did only space permit, to
dig down a little deeper into the treasures of its
place-names and local traditions, and to review
the many quaint notices of its history and
curiosities that are scattered up and down in the
pages of old writers. It is not clear that Camden
had ever visited Man, though he gives a short
account of it at the end of his <i>Magna Britannia</i>.
The natives, he observes, lived chiefly on oat-bread;
whilst both the sheep and cattle were
smaller than in England, "nor have they such
stately fronts." Part of his description is embodied
in a letter that was sent him by the
Bishop, John Merrick. "The women," says
this letter, "whenever they go out of their own
houses, as if mindful of mortality wrap themselves
up in the linen that is to serve for their
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[p. 61]</a></span>
shroud." Similarly, the late Augustus J. C. Hare
says that a married woman in Northumberland,
"in moments of gloom," will take out and try on
her grave-clothes, which she always procures as
part of her trousseau, "and find comfort in the inspection
of the mournful linen." "Such women,"
continues the Bishop, "as are capitally convicted
are sewed up in a sack and thrown from a rock
into the sea. The natives in general are clear
from stealing and begging from door to door,
extremely religious, and to a man exact in their
conformity to the church of England." Preaching
in Jersey, in 1692, the learned Canon Falk
thus boasted, in similar strain, that that island did
not then contain a single dissenter. Giraldus
Cambrensis, as cited by Camden, has a somewhat
amusing story. The island lies, he tells us, "in
the midway between the north of England and
Ireland, occasioning no small dispute among the
ancients to which of the two it belonged. The
dispute was at last thus settled. As venomous
creatures were found upon trial to live here, it
was unanimously judged to the Britans." Ireland,
it is well known, now possesses no poisonous
reptiles: they were banished from its precincts
by St. Patrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[p. 62]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">Camden, very shrewdly, makes the further
observation that "the natives, however, in
language and manners come nearer the Irish, but
with a small mixture of Norwegian." This is
curiously confirmed by the modern study of
place-names, which indicates a considerable Norse
settlement. Other place-names are strongly Erse
in character&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the familiar Balla (in Ballasalla,
Ballabooye, Ballaquine, etc., and ninety-three
others). Slieau, as a generic name for mountain
(Slieau Ruy, Slieau Ree, etc.), and Glen for a
mountain-ravine. "The map of the island," says
the late Canon Isaac Taylor, "contains about
400 names, of which about 20 per cent. are
English, 21 per cent. are Norwegian, and 59 per
cent. are Celtic. These Celtic names are all of
the most characteristic Erse type." The old
Manx language, in fact, is still not altogether
dead, though one no longer hears it spoken as
Welsh is spoken in Wales, or as Gaelic in the
Highlands of Scotland. Gough, in his additions
to Camden, prints two specimens of this old
tongue, though the present writer will not vouch
for their orthography. The charitable disposition
of the people, he says, "is marked by this
proverb: <i>Tra tayn derrey vought cooney lesh
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[p. 63]</a></span>
bought alley, ta fee heme garaghtee</i>: <i>i.e.</i>, When
one poor man relieves another, God Himself
laughs outright for joy." "It is curious to
observe," adds Canon Isaac Taylor&mdash;if we may
revert for the moment to the subject of place-names&mdash;"that
the names which denote places of
Christian worship are all Norwegian; they are
an indication of the late date at which
heathenism must have prevailed, and help to
explain the fact that so many heathen superstitions
and legends still linger in the island."</p>
